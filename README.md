# ps-template-vsc-windows

Personal problemsolving template to use with Windows + VS Code.

Steps:

- Install MinGW at: `C:\mingw64`. I recommend installing https://winlibs.com/
- Install following extensions:
    - C/C++ Extension Pack
    - CMake Tools
- Add `C:\mingw64\bin` to system PATH.
- Open the repository and set the preferred compiler by:
  - Open command palette by `Ctrl + Shift + P`,
  - then search for **CMake: Build**.
